# PathFinding-Visualizer: A Fun React Application

## Overview

Looking for a fun project to explore path finding algorithms? Look no further than PathFinding-Visualizer! With this React application, you can visualize popular algorithms like BFS, DFS, Dijkstraâ€™s, and A*.

## Introduction

Path finding algorithms play an important role in our daily lives. From computer networks to Google Maps, we rely on these algorithms to find the shortest and most efficient routes. But why not take the fun factor up a notch? PathFinding-Visualizer lets you visualize these algorithms in action, complete with CSS animations that bring the algorithms to life.

Let's take a closer look at each algorithm:

### Breadth First Search

Breadth First Search explores equally in all directions. While this algorithm is incredibly useful for regular traversal, it can also be used for procedural map generation, flow field pathfinding, distance maps, and other types of map analysis.

### Depth First Search

Traversing by exploring as far as possible down each path before backtracking, DFS is just as useful as BFS. It can be used to generate a topological ordering, to generate mazes, to traverse trees, to build decision trees, and to discover a solution path with hierarchical choices.

### Dijkstra's Algorithm

Dijkstra's Algorithm lets us prioritize which paths to explore. Instead of exploring all possible paths equally, it favors lower cost paths. This means we can assign lower costs to encourage moving on roads while assigning high costs on highways to avoid them.

### A* (A-Star)

A* is a modification of Dijkstra's Algorithm that is optimized for a single destination. While Dijkstra's Algorithm can find paths to all locations, A* finds paths to one location. It prioritizes paths that seem to be leading closer to a goal.

Ready to get started? Let's jump into the code.

## Getting Started ..
First install node.js which comes with a bundle(npm+npx) to run javascript in local system.
type following commands in the shell to create a react app

```
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```

  
### npm start

Once you've created your app, simply run `npm start` to run it in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser. The page will reload automatically if you make edits, and you'll see any lint errors in the console.

So what are you waiting for? Dive into PathFinding-Visualizer and experience the fun and excitement of path finding algorithms in action!
